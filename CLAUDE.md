# For Claude: this repo

Research, plan, and monitor upcoming trips — flights, hotels, Airbnbs — in
one place, with Claude helping via chat. When a trip is booked, "lock it in"
and it becomes a settled itinerary instead of an active research target.
Private (not because of PII the way `santa-rosa-beach-trip` is, but because
it's personal trip research/budget info) — don't suggest making it public.

## The core idea: one app, many trips

Unlike `santa-rosa-beach-trip` (a bespoke, hand-built app for one specific
trip), this app is generic and data-driven: every trip is a Firestore
document (`trips/<id>`), and the page renders any trip from that data. A new
trip never needs a new repo, a new Cloud Run service, or a new Firestore
database — it's just a new document. That was a deliberate choice: spinning
up new infrastructure per trip would need a live-infrastructure approval
from Erik every time; a Firestore write needs none. Keep it this way — don't
let a future "give each trip its own page" request turn into "give each trip
its own deploy."

**Locking in a trip** (`POST /api/trips/:id/lock`) is *just* a status flip
(`status: "planning" -> "locked"`, `lockedAt` set) — not a data migration,
not a new document, not a new anything. A locked trip:
- Drops out of `/api/cron/check-watches` (a booked trip isn't being shopped
  for anymore — see "Watches" below).
- Gets a "Locked in" badge instead of "Planning" in the trips list.
- Stays fully editable — chat, itinerary, notes all still work. Locking
  isn't a snapshot or a freeze; it's just "this one's decided."
- Can be unlocked (`POST /api/trips/:id/unlock`) if plans change.

If Erik ever wants a *specific* locked trip promoted to its own bespoke app
(styled and customized the way `santa-rosa-beach-trip` is), that's a
separate, explicit, manual step someone (Claude, working with him) does on
request — not something this app automates. Don't build that without being
asked; the whole point of the shared-app design is that most trips never
need it.

## Data model (Firestore)

- Firestore, **Native mode**, database `trip-planner` in `us-central1` (not
  `(default)` — see the same note in `santa-rosa-beach-trip`'s CLAUDE.md for
  why: that project's `(default)` database is legacy Datastore mode).
- `webauthn-credentials/<id>` — passkey public keys; `auth.js` and
  `login.html` are copied verbatim from `santa-rosa-beach-trip` (Face ID /
  Touch ID sign-in, password fallback). Keep them in sync if that pattern
  changes there.
- `trips/<id>` — `{name, destination, dateRange, notes, status
  ("planning"|"locked"), days, createdAt, updatedAt, lockedAt}`. `days` is
  the itinerary once one exists — same shape as `santa-rosa-beach-trip`'s
  (`title`, `date` as an ISO string when known, `dateLabel`, `blocks` as
  `[time, plan]` pairs, `tip`).
  - `trips/<id>/messages/<auto>` — chat history: `{question, answer,
    proposedChange, askedAt, answeredAt}`.
  - `trips/<id>/watches/<auto>` — monitored listings: `{kind
    (flight|hotel|airbnb|other), label, criteria, url, intervalHours,
    lastCheckedAt, lastResult, history}`. `history` is capped at 20 entries.
- `control/watch-cron` — single doc, `{lastRunAt, checked}` from the most
  recent batch run.

## Chat can draft or edit the itinerary

Same confirm-before-save shape as `santa-rosa-beach-trip`: `/api/trips/:id/chat`
gives Claude `web_search` plus a `propose_schedule_change` tool. When asked
to plan or change the day-by-day itinerary, the model proposes the complete
`days` array with a one-line summary; the frontend renders it as an
Apply/Discard card, and only `POST /api/trips/:id/schedule/apply` (fired by
the user's own tap) actually saves it. Keep this shape if you touch this
flow — deliberate, not something to let an LLM silently rewrite.

Runs on `claude-sonnet-5` (tool use + web search).

## Watches: user sets the schedule without touching Cloud Scheduler

Each watch has its own `intervalHours` (6h / day / 3 days / week, chosen in
the UI when adding it). There is **one** Cloud Scheduler job for the whole
app, hitting `POST /api/cron/check-watches` on a fixed base tick (hourly is
plenty) — the route itself decides which watches are actually due by
comparing `intervalHours` against `lastCheckedAt`, and skips everything on a
locked trip. This is the whole point of the design: the user changes a
watch's cadence in the UI any time, with no deploy and no new scheduler job
ever needed. **Don't undo this** by creating per-frequency or per-trip
Scheduler jobs — that reintroduces exactly the "need infrastructure changes
for routine use" problem this app exists to avoid.

`MAX_CHECKS_PER_RUN` (20) caps how many watches one batch tick processes, so
a slow tick or a burst of due watches can't balloon into a large, unbounded
Anthropic bill.

Auth on that one route: `requireLoginOrCron` — either a normal session, or
the `X-Cron-Key` header matching the `cron-secret` Secret Manager value
(same pattern as `college-football-app`'s cron routes). The Scheduler job
itself still needs creating — see "Still to do" below; the deployer service
account has lacked `cloudscheduler.jobs.create` on every project so far.

## Deploy

Same pipeline as `santa-rosa-beach-trip` and `college-football-app`: no
`gcloud` CLI, no local Docker — a Python venv + service account key mints an
OAuth2 token, then direct REST calls (Cloud Build -> Artifact Registry ->
Cloud Run Admin API v2). See `college-football-app`'s
`docs/gcp-deployment.md` for the exact mechanics.

- GCP project `metal-celerity-236019`, region `us-central1`, same as the
  other two apps.
- Needs its own Cloud Run service (`trip-planner`), its own Firestore
  database (`trip-planner`, Native mode, `us-central1` — doesn't exist yet
  as of this writing), and its own Secret Manager secrets:
  `trip-planner-login-username`, `trip-planner-login-password`,
  `trip-planner-cron-secret`. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is shared across all three
  apps, same as always.
- Env vars: `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`, `FIRESTORE_DATABASE_ID=trip-planner`,
  `SITE_LOGIN_USERNAME`, `SITE_LOGIN_PASSWORD`, `SESSION_SECRET` (any long
  random string, used to sign session/challenge cookies — generate one at
  deploy time, don't hardcode it), `CRON_SECRET`.
- No custom domain, same reasoning as `santa-rosa-beach-trip`: the default
  `*.run.app` URL doesn't publish a dedicated cert to public Certificate
  Transparency logs the way a custom domain mapping would.

## Still to do

- Firestore database `trip-planner` doesn't exist yet — create it (Native
  mode, `us-central1`) before first deploy.
- Not deployed to Cloud Run yet.
- Cloud Scheduler job `trip-planner-check-watches`, hourly, POSTing to
  `/api/cron/check-watches` with header `X-Cron-Key: <cron-secret>` — the
  deployer account has lacked permission to create Scheduler jobs on every
  project so far (needs `roles/cloudscheduler.admin`); same blocker as
  `college-football-app`'s docs describe.
- Runtime service account: same known compromise as the other two apps
  (currently would run as the broad-privilege deployer account, not a
  scoped-down one) — see `college-football-app`'s CLAUDE.md for the right
  fix and why it's not done yet.
- Once a real trip exists and is locked in, decide whether "promote to a
  bespoke app" is ever actually wanted before building it — see the note
  above.
